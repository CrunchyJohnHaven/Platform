  <h2>How Sapper Operates</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Military Veterans train-up within a coding bootcamp environment to join development teams led by an experienced developer 'Team Lead.' These teams collaborate with a support staff to build your project to spec.</p> 
  <p>Sapper is a 'teaching hospital for programming,' pairing a learning platform with educator-developers.</p>
  <p>Sapper operates exactly how a military unit does. Each member of a unit is responsible for the education of incoming members.</p>
  <p>Students who graduate to earn their Sapper Coding Tab may continue to work with their team, either as freelance Sapper-Coders in Silicon Valley or remotely, or they may take their experience to the job-market.</p>
  <p>Sapper Coding acts as a beachhead for military to enter the software engineering industry with real-world skills.</p>
  <p>Sapper partners with great companies looking looking to build great software products and support miltary Veterans.</p>
